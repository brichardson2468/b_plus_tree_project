# B+ Tree Project
## Data Structures Semester Project on B+ Trees
### Motivation
My motivation for this project was incorporating a data set I was using for my data visualization class. It's a dataset that tracks U.S. Mental Health statistics starting at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic and extends to the current day. I chose this dataset because prior to starting my computer science program, I worked in the mental health field for over a decade and saw the effects first hand of the pandemic on worsening mental health. I wanted a way to visualize this. So the goal was to create this project so that I could more quickly change the search range of the data in order to more quickly visualize the data.
